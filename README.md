# DIGHUM-100-for-Joy-Zhou
This repository is created for Berkeley's DIGHUM 100 course.
The project contained in this repository investigates the influence of Covid-19 on employments in the developed and developing country. I would also like to acknowledge UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, as this project has referenced the codes and statistical knowledge from its course demo and slides. 
The dataset used in this project is selected from Kaggle, and its link is https://www.kaggle.com/vineethakkinapalli/impact-of-covid19-on-employment-ilostat. 

This repository now contains all the notebooks, dataset, and storyboards for the described project.
