# DIGHUM-100-for-Joy-Zhou
This repository is created for Berkeley's DIGHUM 100 course.
The project contained in this repository investigate the influence of Covid-19 on employments in the developed and developing country. I would also like to acknowledge UC Berkeley's Data 8 course, as this project has referenced the codes and statistical knowledge from its course demo and slides.
